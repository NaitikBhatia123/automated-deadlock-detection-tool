# Automated Deadlock Detection Tool

## Project Overview

The Automated Deadlock Detection Tool is a Java-based software designed to detect deadlocks in systems where multiple processes compete for shared resources. [cite: 3, 4] It provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to input system parameters and visualize deadlock detection results. [cite: 4]

### Objective

The project aims to develop a real-time deadlock detection system that analyzes resource allocation, request matrices, and available resources to determine whether a deadlock has occurred. [cite: 5]

## Functionalities

* **User-Friendly GUI:** Built using Java Swing for easy data entry. [cite: 6, 7]
    
* **Dynamic Input Handling:** Allows users to input the number of processes and resources, along with allocation and request matrices. [cite: 6, 7]
    
* **Real-Time Deadlock Detection:** Employs an efficient algorithm to analyze resource allocation and detect potential deadlocks. [cite: 8, 9]
    
* **Result Interpretation:** Clearly displays results with color-coded deadlock alerts. [cite: 8, 9]

## Technology Used

* **Programming Language:** Java [cite: 9]
    
* **Libraries Used:** Java Swing, AWT [cite: 9]
    
* **Algorithm Used:** Resource Allocation Graph-Based Detection [cite: 9]
    
* **Other Tools:** Banker's Algorithm, Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) [cite: 9]

## Conclusion and Future Scope

### Conclusion

The Automated Deadlock Detection Tool provides an effective solution for identifying and analyzing deadlocks in a system. [cite: 14, 15, 16, 17] Its Java-based implementation and GUI enable users to dynamically input resource allocation and request matrices. [cite: 14, 15, 16, 17] The tool's deadlock detection algorithms deliver clear results, automating the deadlock detection process, reducing manual intervention, and improving system reliability. [cite: 14, 15, 16, 17]
